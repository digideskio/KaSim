* Relational properties:
------------------------------------------------------------
In agent R, the binding state of site x, the binding state of site c, the binding state of site cr, and the binding state of site n, are entangled by the following 4-d relationship:
	R(x!E@x,c!free,cr!free,n!free)
	R(x!E@x,c!R@c,cr!R@n,n!free)
	R(x!E@x,c!R@c,cr!free,n!free)
	R(x!E@x,c!R@c,cr!free,n!R@cr)
	R(x!free,c!free,cr!free,n!free)

------------------------------------------------------------
* Non relational properties:
------------------------------------------------------------
The binding state of site x in agent E ranges over free and R@x.
The binding state of site c in agent R ranges over free and R@c.
The binding state of site cr in agent R ranges over free and R@n.
The binding state of site n in agent R ranges over free and R@cr.
The binding state of site x in agent R ranges over free and E@x.

When the agent R has its site c bound to the site c of a R, and its site cr bound to the site n of a R, then both instances of R are necessarily the same.
When the agent R has its site c bound to the site c of a R, and its site n bound to the site cr of a R, then both instances of R are necessarily the same.
